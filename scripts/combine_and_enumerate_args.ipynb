It is far more pleasant, easier and faster to use than anything from Canon.\\n12. That's faster than its predecessor despite the 50 per cent greater resolution and matches up to the Canon EOS 650D.\\n13. Because some people think that a newer camera makes them a better photographer, others want to feel superior than Canon shooter or at least not inferior.\\n14. Nikon is putting better sensors into its low-end cameras, which means, in short, that the D3300 takes nicer photographs than comparable Canon models.\\n15. For this reason, although the SCIENTIFIC results attest that the Nikon D800 is superior to all other Cameras and MUCH BETTER THAN THE Canon 5Dmk3, some sandwich-boards of Canon are invading our photos-forums to make disinformation.\\n16.

However, python looks nicer and in many ways is actually much simpler and for many tasks much easier than php.\\n12. No, Python is way better and easier than php.\\n13. Java/ASP/Ruby/Python/Perl/C is better, and faster than PHP .\\n14. discounting those differences, I found that python was orders of magnitude easier, briefer to code, and got the job done faster than curl working concurrently (on windows/apache2, mind you) because curl and php has weird issues, even when running php as fastcgi .\\n15. The results from the poll showed unanimously that the impression that Java/ASP/Ruby/Python/Perl/C are better and faster than PHP topped the charts.\\n16. I\\'m not sure the exact reason for python to be faster than PHP, but I would bet its because of Google\\'s influence with Python.\\n17. Poor PHP code is probably slower than high quality python code but good PHP may also perform better than poor Python.\\n18. - Faster then PHP.\\n19.

In addition, traditional Chinese medicine has proven superior to Western medicine in the treatment of skin, liver and kidneys diseases, as well as many other diseases.\\n9. Using inflammation as a last ditch scapegoat to explain away pain without thinking further is the reason Western medicine is generally clumsy and inferior to Chinese medicine in the management of muscluloskeletal pain.\\n10. It is also universally recognised that Chinese medicine and other medical systems based on prana / chi energy concept are much safer than western medicine too.\\n11. Now, the western medicine solved this problem faster and more effective than the Traditional Chinese Medicine.\\n12. On the other hand, as I explained in the article, western medicine is superior to Chinese medicine in dealing with trauma and emergency situations.\\n13. Scientists on university faculties may be afraid to say things like \"western medicine is better than Chinese medicine\".\\n14.

The QuickSort algorithm is more difficult to explain and understand, and its performance envelope has some potentially bad worst-case scenarios, but its typical performance is at least as good as, and often better than, Merge Sort.\\n2. Quicksort in particular requires little additional space and exhibits good cache locality, and this makes it faster than merge sort in many cases.\\n3. Most of the time quicksort is faster than merge sort.\\n4. Merge sort is slower than quicksort on random data, but doesn't deteriorate on nearly sorted data.\\n5. The price for that reliability is that the average case of merge sort is slower than the average case of quicksort because the constant factor of merge sort is larger .\\n6. On the other hand, a quicksort provides better performance for unsorted or random data than a merge sort.\\n7. A quicksort is generally considered to be faster than a merge sort but isn't stable and doesn't guarantee n log(n) performance.\\n8. Unless I'm reading this wrong it is saying that Merge sort can never be slower than quicksort, which is probably the source of sehr alt's question.\\n9. Merge sort, on the other hand, usually requires more memory and is a bit slower than Quicksort on random inputs, but it's a stable sort, won't degenerate, and works well with sequential-access data.\\n10. Rather than worrying about remembering how to implement QuickSort and why it was better than an Insertion Sort or a Bubble Sort, just use the modified Merge Sort that Josh Bloch and his colleagues had helpfully provided.\\n11. Another thing is that Merge sort is easier to implement than the quicksort algorithm, but it uses more memory.\\n12. Also as part of this jira, I will implement a new merge sort algorithm that will hopefully better utilize cluster resources than our current sort, which is based on Quicksort.\\n13. With O(n^2) (worst case that rarely happens), quicksort is potentially far slower than the O(nlogn) of the merge sort.\\n14. Even in arrays, they're quicker than standard Quicksort (and frequently used as an enhancement to Quicksort, on the smaller sub arrays it generates).\\n15. A good merge sort implementation will have better average performance than a poor quicksort implementation.\\n16. I guess Introsort is better than Quicksort, otherwise there would be no need to invent it (it uses Quicksort but switches to Heapsort if it sees that Quicksort is not doing well enough).\\n17. On a two cores machine I got that parallel merge sort is more than 2x faster than sequential quicksort and up to 25% faster than parallel quicksort but at the cost of additional O(n) space.\\n18. TimSort is derived from merge sort and insertion sort and performs better than quicksort in most real-world datasets, especially for datasets that are partially ordered.\\n19. For example, merge sort may be somewhat easier to describe than quicksort, and less subject to ''off-by-one'' errors, but the simplest implementation requires linked lists, which would increase the memory requirements.\",\n",

The all-weather-wood foundation (AWWF) has proven to be quicker, less expensive and simpler to build than its concrete equivalent.\\n13. Glulam is made by sticking together smaller pieces of wood to create structural members with a greater tensile strength than steel, and that can resist compression better than concrete.\\n14. The marina at Keppel Bay features floating, concrete \"Unifloat\" docks, which, according to Bellingham, is a superior material: Not only is it durable and fire resistant, it\\'s also better for maintaining water quality than traditional treated-wood pilings.\\n15. While wood is still lighter than concrete, and a better insulator than steel, they\\'ll be putting wood tanks on newer buildings .\\n16. It is also lighter than concrete, faster to assemble and gets lots of green points for sequestering carbon dioxide.\\n17. When built correctly a wood foundation is far superior to concrete.\\n18.
