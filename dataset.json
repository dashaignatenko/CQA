            "Args_2": "Another thing is that Merge sort is easier to implement than the quicksort algorithm, but it uses more memory.\nAlso as part of this jira, I will implement a new merge sort algorithm that will hopefully better utilize cluster resources than our current sort, which is based on Quicksort.\nWith O(n^2) (worst case that rarely happens), quicksort is potentially far slower than the O(nlogn) of the merge sort.\nEven in arrays, they're quicker than standard Quicksort (and frequently used as an enhancement to Quicksort, on the smaller sub arrays it generates).\nA good merge sort implementation will have better average performance than a poor quicksort implementation.\nI guess Introsort is better than Quicksort, otherwise there would be no need to invent it (it uses Quicksort but switches to Heapsort if it sees that Quicksort is not doing well enough).\nOn a two cores machine I got that parallel merge sort is more than 2x faster than sequential quicksort and up to 25% faster than parallel quicksort but at the cost of additional O(n) space.\nTimSort is derived from merge sort and insertion sort and performs better than quicksort in most real-world datasets, especially for datasets that are partially ordered.\nFor example, merge sort may be somewhat easier to describe than quicksort, and less subject to ''off-by-one'' errors, but the simplest implementation requires linked lists, which would increase the memory requirements."
