      "Summary:\nWhen comparing the strength of Hulk and Superman, several arguments come into play. While Hulk has the potential to reach limitless strength [1], Superman would not allow him to get to that level [1]. However, it should be noted that in the comics, Superman is not physically superior to Hulk [2]. Hulk may have difficulty in articulating himself, with Superman being generally more eloquent [3]. Regarding the quality of films, the argument states that \"Hulk\" (Ang Lee's version) was better than \"Superman\" (Donner's version) [4]. In terms of intelligence, while Hulk is not as smart as Bruce Banner, Superman is smarter than the Hulk [5]. Comparing the two films, \"Superman Returns\" is considered worse than the discarded Hulk film [6]. In terms of speed, Superman is faster than Hulk [7][13]. Ultimately, the decision of which character is better comes down to personal preference.\n\nArguments Used: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 13",
      "Summary:\nWhen comparing the strength of Hulk and Superman, it is important to consider several factors.

In terms of physical superiority, Superman outside of PC versions is not physically superior to Hulk [2]. However, Superman is smarter than the Hulk [5] and is also faster [13]. It is worth noting that there are mixed opinions on the quality of films featuring these characters, with some arguing that \"Hulk\" directed by Ang Lee was better than \"Superman\" directed by Donner [4], while others claim the opposite [16]. Taking all these points into account, it is clear that Superman is the better option.\n\nRelevant Arguments Used:\n1, 2, 5, 13, 4, 16",
      "Summary:\nSuperman and Hulk are often compared in terms of strength. While Hulk can potentially reach limitless strength, Superman would never let him get to that level if he is going all out [1]. In terms of physical superiority, any Superman outside of the PC (Post-Crisis) version is not considered stronger than Hulk [2]. Hulk may not speak eloquently, but Superman is not known for his communication skills [3]. The quality of films featuring the characters is subjective, but some argue that Ang Lee's \"Hulk\" is better than Donner's \"Superman\" [4]. Additionally, Hulk is not as intelligent as his alter ego, Bruce Banner, but Superman still possesses more intelligence than Hulk [5]. As for speed, it is redundant to compare Superman's speed with the Hulk's [7]. There are no definitive showings of Superman or Captain Marvel being physically superior to Hulk [8]. The argument that Batman would be able to analyze and create a gamma-reducer to neutralize Hulk's strength favors Superman in this situation [9, 10]. Juggernaut may have a constant level of strength and be more intelligent than the Hulk, but this is not the main point of comparison [11]. It is important to note that Superman is faster than Hulk [12, 13]. The subjective preference of Superman's films over Hulk's is not relevant to the comparison of strength [15]. Superman is often regarded as significantly better than Hulk, but the extent of this comparison is not further elaborated [16, 17]. Finally, it is stated that Hulk is underrated and not as bad as commonly believed [18]. The involvement of Leinil Francis Yu, known for his artwork in \"Superman Birthright\" and \"Indestructible Hulk,\" does not contribute to the comparison of strength [20].\n\nArguments used: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 15, 16, 17, 18"

      "Summary: In comparing Kennedy and Nixon, several arguments suggest that Kennedy was a better candidate. These include Kennedy's superior image and appearance [2, 7, 8], his better performance on camera [10], and the perception that he was mentally stable compared to Nixon [1]. However, some arguments raise doubts about Kennedy's character and qualifications [3, 5], as well as Nixon being considered smarter [12, 20]. \n\nRelevant arguments:\n\n1.

      "Summary:\nKennedy and Nixon were both controversial figures, but Kennedy was generally perceived as the better option. Kennedy had a better image and presentation, appearing more charismatic and likable than Nixon. Additionally, Kennedy's superior performance on camera helped him win the 1960 election. Despite this, Nixon was believed to be smarter than Kennedy, and some viewed him as a more qualified candidate. However, in terms of personal character, Kennedy was not necessarily better than Nixon, but he wasn't worse either.\n \nMost topical avenues of comparison:\n1. Image and presentation: Kennedy looked better than Nixon [2, 4, 7, 8].\n2. Perception of intelligence: Some believed Nixon was smarter [12, 20].\n3.
