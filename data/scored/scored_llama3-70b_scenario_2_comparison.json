On the other hand, argument 2 claims that snowboarding is harder for beginners due to its restrictive nature and difficulty in turning. It seems that the ease of learning depends on individual experiences and learning styles.\n\n**Difficulty and Danger**\n\nArgument 1 claims that snowboarding is easier and less dangerous than skiing, while argument 2 suggests that both are equally difficult to master. It's essential to note that both skiing and snowboarding come with their own set of risks and challenges.\n\n**Artistic Expression and Speed**\n\nArgument 3 highlights the difference in balance and control between skiing (left-right balance) and snowboarding (front-back balance).
