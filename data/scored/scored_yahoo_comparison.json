Generally speaking, the boiling points of pure substances are going to be higher and sharper than those of impure substances.

Note; it does matter whether you're looking at \"fastest\" in terms of time to boil based on a standard energy flux\/volume ratio, energy\/mass ratio, or for the lowest temperature.  Different substances need different amount of energy to reach a given temperature based on their heat capacities, and I believe that milk has the lowest heat capacity, meaning that it would take the least amount of energy to bring milk to a given temperature than it would take for the other two.
