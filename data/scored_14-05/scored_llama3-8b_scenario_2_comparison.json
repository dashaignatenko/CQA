This implies that volleyball may be less physically demanding than basketball. Argument 6 also suggests that volleyball had too little physical contact for the 6-foot-2 specimen, implying that basketball may be more physically demanding.\n\n**Global Appeal:** Argument 2 mentions that Football (like Basketball, like Waterpolo) is inferior to Rugby Union or Volleyball, because one can bring the family to follow the latter group more or less everywhere around the world. This implies that volleyball has a broader global appeal than basketball.\n\n**Personal Preference:** Argument 1 and 4 suggest that some individuals may prefer volleyball over basketball. Argument 6 also implies that the 6-foot-2 specimen was better at basketball than soccer or volleyball, but it's unclear if they preferred basketball over volleyball.\n\n**Comparison to Other Sports:** Argument 5 compares soccer to basketball, stating that soccer is a contact sport and just as sweaty as basketball. This implies that soccer and basketball share some similarities. Argument 7 mentions the women's beach volleyball competition, but it's unclear how this relates to the comparison between basketball and volleyball.\n\nIn conclusion, while there are some arguments that suggest volleyball may be faster or more appealing globally, there are also arguments that imply basketball may be more physically demanding or preferred by some individuals.
