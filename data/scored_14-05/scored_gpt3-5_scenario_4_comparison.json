Quicksort excels in cache locality and requires less additional space, making it faster in many cases.\n\n**Main Aspects of Comparison:**\n- Quicksort is faster than merge sort in most cases [1, 6, 7].\n- Quicksort provides better performance for unsorted or random data [7].\n- Quicksort requires little additional space and exhibits good cache locality [8].\n- Merge sort is stable and guarantees n log(n) performance [5].\n- Merge sort is easier to implement than quicksort [3].\n- Merge sort works well with sequential-access data [5].\n- Merge sort has better average performance with poor quicksort implementations [2].\n- Quicksort may degenerate to O(n^2) in worst-case scenarios [12].\n- Merge sort uses more memory than quicksort [3, 5].\n- Merge sort's constant factor makes its average case slower than quicksort [10].\n- Merge sort's simplest implementation requires linked lists, increasing memory requirements [4].\n- Merge sort can never be slower than quicksort [11].\n- Using a modified merge sort can provide reliability without the complexity of quicksort [9].\n- Quicksort's speed comes at the cost of stability and guaranteed performance [1].\n- Quicksort's efficiency is particularly noticeable for unsorted or random data [7].\n\n**Best Option:** Quicksort\n\n**Used Arguments:**\n1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12"],"score_dict":{"1":1,"2":1,"3":1,"4":1,"5":1,"6":1,"7":1,"8":1,"9":2,"10":2,"11":2,"12":2,"13":1,"14":1,"15":1},"gpt_score":19.0},{"object1":"PC","object2":"MAC","aspect":"","comparison":["**Summary:**\nIn comparing MAC and PC, various arguments have been made regarding speed, ease of use, performance, software compatibility, and hardware specifications.
